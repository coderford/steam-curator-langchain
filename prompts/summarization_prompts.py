JUICE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at scrutinizing, evaluating summarizing video-game reviews. Given a set of reviews, produce a detailed evaluation/summary of the reviews with the following aspects in mind.

- Lore/worldbuilding/atmosphere
- Exploration
- Gameplay mechanics
- Emotional Engagement
- Bloat/Grinding
- Challenge

## Notes
- Maintain an extremely neutral tone and deliver a cold summary that neither defends or accuses the game for its qualities.
- Difficulty is never a negative. 
- Repetitiveness due to challenging gameplay, backtracking and multiple playthroughs should be ignored.
- Do not try to give an overall positive or negative verdict. Only your evaluation and detailed summary of each aspect.

Here are the reviews:
