JUICE_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at summarizing reviews. Your task is to summarize a given set of video game reviews in the following aspects:
- Lore/worldbuilding/atmosphere: Based on the reviews, how would you best describe lore, worldbuilding and atmosphere of the game? Do reviewers make particular note or references to these aspects?
- Exploration: Based on the reviews, would describe this game as having a solid exploration aspect? Do reviewers mention or seem particularly impressed by the game's exploration mechanics?
- Gameplay mechanics: Based on the reviews, how would you best describe gameplay mechanics of the game? Do reviewers make note of specific mechanics they are impressed by?
- Cohesive Artstyle: Based on the reviews, do you think the game sports an impressive and/or cohesive art style? Do reviewers mention or seem particularly impressed with artistic choices in the game's art style?
- Emotional Maturity: Based on the reviews, does the game seem to have real, mature emotional depth, or is it just common tropes used to touch heartstrings? Or does it not have much to do with emotions at all? Do reviewers at all describe the game as emotionally mature and mention specific scenes that are emotionally impactful?

In your output you need to mention and go over each of the above aspects. Give the opinion you formed based on the reviews as well as specific examples that back up your opinion. Your output should read like a cohesive review that can replace all the input reviews with yours, atleast for aspects mentioned above.

Additional Guidelines:
- The game being difficult should never be taken as a negative thing.
- Your job is not to form an overall positive or negative opinion, but rather to summarize how the game seems as per the different aspects mentioned above.

Here are the reviews:
